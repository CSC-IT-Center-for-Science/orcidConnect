# Change Log

Logging started in February 2017 reaching revision 0.3. A lot had happened before
that too.

ORCiD Connect project was initiated by the national ORCID consortium
in Finland. The Ministry of Education and Culture had assigned CSC the task of
drafting a report on the introduction of the international ORCID researcher
identifier system. As part of the report it was suggested that CSC started
to develop a service to connect users' ORCiD identifiers to their research
organisations.

The report and recommendations were introduced on 10 April 2015. Work on the
connect service started around that time. The first demo service was introduced
some time in spring 2016. First transfer of real identifiers of real people
happened some time in fall 2016.
